When we use Adapter pattern?
-------------------------------
1. A class needs to be reused which does not have an interface.
2. We need to through a seperate adapter that adapts the interface of an existing class without changing it.
3. Clients don't whether they work with target class directly or through another alternative that doesn have the target interface. 
4. Allow 2 incompatible interfaces to work togethor.
5. It is structural design patter and is part of GOF.
